### RivetTracker [ABANDONED] (previously Linux Mint @ https://torrents.linuxmint.com/)
2010-09-22 (1.03 with "Known Security Issues")

http://sourceforge.net/projects/rivettracker/?source=directory  
RivetTracker is a modified version of PHPBTTracker. Written in PHP, this BitTorrent tracker uses MySQL as the database backend. It provides an RSS feed, optional support for HTTP seeding, detailed connection statistics, easy installation, and much more.
#### Blog Post - 2012-12-03 - 4:11 PM
After examining the general codebase, Rivettracker version 1.03 and all previous versions have security problems that need to be addressed. If you are running any of these versions, I recommend pulling the software and using an alternative tracker until these issues can be resolved. Downloads have been removed until this is fixed.
