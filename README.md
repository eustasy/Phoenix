A lightweight BitTorrent Tracker written in PHP, with an SQL backend, for people that just want to host a tracker, not the torrent listing site.

## Installation

### What Do You Need?

#### Required
* PHP >= 5.3
* A MySQLI supported database, such as MySQL >= 4.1

#### Recommended
* Nginx >= 1.8.0, Apache, OR lighttpd.
* [A supported version of PHP](http://php.net/supported-versions.php)
* MySQL >= 5.5 OR MariaDB >= 5.5

#### _Really_ Recommended
* Nginx >= 1.8.0
* [The latest version of PHP](http://php.net/supported-versions.php)
* MariaDB >= 10

### Install Guide
1. Copy `_settings/phoenix.default.php` to `_settings/phoenix.custom.php`
2. Edit the variables in `_settings/phoenix.custom.php`
2. Upload all the `.php` and `.sh` files to your server.
4. Load `admin.php` in your browser and run the `Setup` option.
5. Change `$settings['db_reset'] = false;` OR delete `admin.php` from your server.

## Configuration
Configuration should take place in `_settings/phoenix.custom.php`, NOT `_settings/phoenix.default.php`. Phoenix _will_ attempt to use the default configuration if yours is missing.

#### Disabling Cleaning
In requests, to disable cleaning one would edit the file `_settings/phoenix.custom.php` and change the variable `settings['clean_with_cron'] = true` to `settings['clean_with_cron'] = false`

## Cron Jobs
What's important to note, is that cron is an automated task that runs a shell script or command.
Within your cronfile, all entires are in the format `minute hour day (of the month) month day (of the week)  command`
Each value, besides the command, is in a numerical format.  You can also use wildcards in any point in the cronfile.
For instance, `30 0 1 5 * rm /user/*` removes /user/* 30 minutes into the First of May every day of the week. 
Commas between integers will allow the command to run multiple times in the respective value.
`5,10 0 10 * 1  mkdir /opt/server` runs mkdir /opt/server every five and ten minutes into every Monday and tenth of every month.
Within bash, run the `crontab -e` command to edit the file.

Specificially, to run `_cron/hourly/backup-database.sh` every hour of every day, you'd run the following:
`crontab -e`, and once the file's add `0 * * * *  php _cron/hourly/backup-database.sh` to the file.

To run `_cron/hourly/clean-and-optimize.php` hourly, you'd do the same thing except with with a different filename
`0 * * * *  php _cron/hourly/clean-and-optimize.sh`.
